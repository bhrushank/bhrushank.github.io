		<h1> Destiny </h1>
		<p>
			
			Destiny is an online first-person shooter video game in a "mythic science fiction" MMO setting. It was developed by Bungie and published by Activision as part of a ten-year publishing deal. The game was released on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One video game consoles on September 9, 2014.

The game's style has been described as a first-person shooter that will incorporate massively multiplayer online game (MMO) elements, but Bungie has avoided defining Destiny as a traditional MMO game. Instead, the game has been referred to as a "shared-world shooter," as it lacks many of the characteristics of a traditional MMO game. For instance, rather than players being able to see and interact with all other players in the game or on a particular server—as is the case in many conventional MMO games—Destiny will include on-the-fly matchmaking that will allow players to see and interact only with other players with whom they are "matched" by the game. Events may happen in-game that are not necessarily controlled or planned by the developer, which will help to create a dynamic developing experience for Bungie and a dynamic playing experience for gamers.

			Destiny is set seven hundred years into the future in a post-apocalyptic world. The setting follows a prosperous period of exploration, peace, and technological advancement known as the Golden Age. In a universe where humans have spread out and colonized planets in the Solar System, an event known as "the Collapse" saw the mysterious dissolution of these colonies, the end of the Golden Age, and mankind teetering on the brink of extinction. The only known survivors of the Collapse are those living on Earth, who were saved by "the Traveler," a white, spherical celestial body whose appearance centuries before had enabled humans to reach the stars. The Traveler now hovers above the last safe city on Earth, and its presence allows the Guardians — the defenders of the City — the ability to wield an unknown power, only referred to as "The Light."

			Upon mankind's first attempt to repopulate and reconstruct after the Collapse, it is discovered that hostile alien races have occupied mankind's former colonies and civilizations, and are now encroaching upon the City. The player takes on the role of one such Guardian, and is tasked with reviving the Traveler while investigating and destroying the alien threats before humanity is completely wiped out.

			Destiny incorporates a new game engine that allows global illumination and real-time dynamic lighting to occur together. In addition, Bungie's goal is that Destiny will natively render graphics at 1080p on both the Xbox One and PlayStation 4. An innovation in Bungie's "hopper" technology, which has been the backbone for Halo '​s matchmaking system, will allow better player matchmaking in order to create a more natural experience in either cooperative or competitive multiplayer modes.

			Destiny players will be given the opportunity to create a character, choosing both a race and a class. Unlike choosing a race, choosing a class has a distinctive effect on how Destiny is played and on character development. Each class has its own 'focus', which is a special ability that can be used in co-op missions and competitive matches to turn the tides in the player's favor. These focuses' abilities can be offensive, defensive, or buffing (for the player's three-person 'fireteam'). The most effective ability of a focus is called a 'super,' which is a skill move that a Guardian can use in battle. Each super has an upgradable skill tree.
