		<h1> Wolfenstein: The New Order </h1>
		<p>
			Wolfenstein: The New Order is an action-adventure first-person shooter video game developed by MachineGames and published by Bethesda Softworks. It was released on May 20, 2014 for the Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows. The game is the first main entry in the Wolfenstein series since 2009's Wolfenstein. Set in alternative history 1960s Europe in a world where the Nazis won the Second World War, the single-player story follows war veteran William "B.J." Blazkowicz and his efforts to stop the Nazis rule over the world.

			The game is played from a first-person perspective and its levels are navigated on-foot. Players control Blazkowicz as he attempts to halt the Nazi operation and recover justice in the world. The story is arranged in chapters, which players complete in order to progress through the story. A morality choice in the prologue alters the game's entire storyline; some characters and small plot points are replaced across timelines. The game features a variety of weapons, most of which can be dual wielded. A cover system is also present.

			Development began in 2010, soon after id Software gave MachineGames the rights for the franchise. The development team envisioned Wolfenstein: The New Order as a first-person action-adventure game, taking inspiration from previous games in the series and particularly focusing on the combat and adventure elements. The game's attempt to delve into character development of Blazkowicz is a break from series tradition—a choice from the developers to interest players in the story. They also aimed to portray him in a heroic fashion, as opposed to an antihero. Development duties were shared between many studios worldwide. At release, Wolfenstein: The New Order received generally positive reviews, with praise particularly directed at the combat and the narrative of the game.

			Wolfenstein: The New Order is an action-adventure shooter game played from a first-person perspective. To progress through the story, players take on enemies throughout levels. The game utilizes a health system in which players' health is divided into separate sections that regenerate; if an entire section is lost, players must use a health pack to replenish the missing health

			Wolfenstein: The New Order only features a single-player mode. The team felt that dividing focus and resources across both a single-player and an online multiplayer mode would be less efficient. When questioned about the lack of an online multiplayer mode, Öjerfors explained that the decision was simple. "If we could take every bit of energy and sweat the studio has and pour all that into the single-player campaign, it gives us the resources to make something very, very cool, compared to if we would also have to divert some of our resources to making multiplayer." Executive producer Jerk Gustafsson attributed the choice to the style of game the team is familiar with, stating that MachineGames is "a single-player studio"
