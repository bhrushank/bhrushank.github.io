		<h1> Splinter Cell Blacklist </h1>
		<p>
			
			Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist (or shortened to Splinter Cell: Blacklist) is an action-adventure stealth game published by Ubisoft. It is the seventh installment of Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell series and is the direct sequel to Splinter Cell: Conviction. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Wii U, and Xbox 360, in North America on August 20, 2013, Australia on August 22, 2013, Europe on August 23, 2013, and Japan on September 5, 2013. This is the first Splinter Cell game that stars Eric Johnson as Sam Fisher. After the previous title, which featured a bigger focus on action, developers promise to bring back gameplay elements of the older games. Thus the players can choose to play in three styles: Assault, Ghost and Panther.

			It's been six month after the events of Conviction, Third Echelon has been terminated after a failed assassination attempt on President's life. But when new terrorist plot known as "The Blacklist" puts America's fate hanging in a balance, Patricia Caldwell, the US President, responds by forming Fourth Echelon, a new special operations & counter-terrorism unit with former Third Echelon agent Sam Fisher as the commander of the unit alongside his ally Anna Grímsdóttir as the unit's tech-ops control officer and second-in command. Added as a new member are Isaac Briggs, former CIA agent and new Fourth Echelon agent and Charlie Cole, 4E's resident hacker and technology officer. Now the unit's new mission: hunt down those responsible for the attack and stop the Blacklist countdown before its too late.

			Splinter Cell: Blacklist gameplay mechanics build off of those introduced in Conviction. Hence, Mark & Execute, the projection of information in the environment, interrogation/torture sequences (which has been completely removed due to negative response) and parkour. Furthermore, the games point system introduced in Conviction also seems to have returned in some iteration. With that said, the games shadow gray scale environment feature to notify you if you are in the shadows or not is gone, instead Sam's goggles and the light on his back will glow when he is in the dark.

			Killing in Motion lets Sam strike with lethal precision by marking and executing multiple enemies in one fluid motion. Active Sprint allows him to traverse the environment easily and fluidly, climb walls and leap over barriers in order to reach his next target while on the move. Furthermore, Sam and his team are aware of terrorist attacks in real time thanks to the Strategic Mission Interface (SMI). The SMI allows the team to receive data about mission objectives while on the move. Players can earn money for completing missions and objectives and buy upgraded weapons and items from the SMI hub aboard the Paladin.

			Blacklist also has new so called "RPG"- elements included in the gameplay. Between missions, the player will be aboard the "Paladin", an upgraded version of the "Hercules", which will serve as HQ for all Fourth Echelon operations. On the Paladin you will be able to talk to your team members, customize your equipment (loadout) and start your Co-Op / Deniable Ops and Spies vs. Mercs missions.
